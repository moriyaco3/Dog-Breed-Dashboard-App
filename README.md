# Dog Breed Dashboard

An interactive data exploration app for dog breeds, built with **Python** and **Streamlit**, using data from **TheDogAPI**.

The app is designed for people who are interested in dogs and want to compare breeds based on size, life span, temperament, and other characteristics — especially useful for people looking to choose a dog.
